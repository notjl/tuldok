## neovim config
Uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as plugin manager.

Most of the configurations are from the old [neovim configuration](../../../oldnvim/)
With lazy.nvim, atomicity is possible especially with plugins which can be found installed
and configured in [plugins folder](./lua/okat/plugins/).
